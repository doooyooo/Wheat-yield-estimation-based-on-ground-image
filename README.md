Wheat is a staple cereal crop of global importance, and accurate yield estimation is essential for agricultural management and food security. Traditional methods rely on satellite or UAV imagery, which are costly and complex to operate. As a low-cost alternative, ground-based RGB imagery has attracted increasing attention. However, existing methods remain constrained by the limited representational capacity of manually designed features or the black box nature of end to end deep learning models. Therefore, this study develops a ground-based RGB image driven framework for wheat yield estimation, within which the roles of explicit handcrafted features and deep implicit features extracted from ground imagery are systematically evaluated. Explicit features quantify the morphological and color characteristics of wheat spikes from three aspects: spatial geometry, wavelet-based texture, and visible vegetation indices. Implicit features are extracted from a VGG-based segmentation encoder, which captures high-level semantic representations of the imagery. Four regression models, including RF, SVM, KNN, and XGBoost, are employed for yield estimation. Results show that both feature types are informative, with model performance varying substantially across feature configurations. Among all models, XGBoost using implicit features achieves the highest accuracy (R² = 0.85, RMSE = 1015.77 kg·ha⁻¹, rRMSE = 12.9%), outperforming models using only explicit features, while achieving accuracy comparable to models based on combined explicit and implicit features. Overall, the proposed approach clarifies the relative roles of different feature representations and provides a flexible and practical solution for low-cost, scalable crop yield assessment based on ground-based RGB imagery.
